# Oscilloscope-connection
June 2017   

This project was created with the Missouri S&T Electromagnetic Compatibility Laboratory.  

It is an Android app that sends commands to a Raspberry Pi using Socket. The Raspberry Pi runs a Python server and receives commands from the Android client. Using PyVISA-py, the Pi communicates with the oscilloscope via SCIPI commands. The oscilloscope receives commands from the Raspberry Pi and sends data back to the Pi,which communicates it back to the Android client.
